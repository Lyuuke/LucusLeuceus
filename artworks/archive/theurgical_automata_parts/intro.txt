The texture set coded "theurgical_automata_parts" contains textures of
curious (probably) parts used to build modular golems with theurgical powers.

This texture set was intended for my concept mod "Gehlon Reflection".

THIS TEXTURE SET WAS CLOSED
    LONG BEFORE THIS INTRO WAS WRITTEN. (Hy, 20250512)
