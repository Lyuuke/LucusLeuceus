The texture set coded "scavenger" is intended for 1. the modpack "The Winter
Rescue", and 2. a request from @yaoyaoDream, both of which required junk items
that can be scavenged, with a post-apocalyptic/post-war stage assumed.

Each of the artworks meets one of three criteria:

* The item is a scrap that can be recycled as raw material, or contains data
that can be retrieved.

* The item is something consumable, presumably a chemical product that cannot
be produced after local industry has been destroyed.

* The item is a useful tool, but has not been added by major mods.

THIS TEXTURE SET IS OPEN. (Hy, 20250203)
