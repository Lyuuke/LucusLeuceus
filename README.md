# Info
I use this repository to dump personal artworks (mostly, if not exclusively, 16×16 pixel arts or typical *Minecraft* textures) that I have decided to put into the public domain.

Since all the artworks here follow the CC0 licence, you are free to use (even for commercial uses), adapt, and reproduce them without my permission nor crediting me (but if you like — again, this is not necessary — mentioning me as *Hydracor* or *Lyuuke* is both fine).

I may upload new artworks from time to time, especially when there is an upcoming festival, or calendary events. The files are categorized according to their themes. Also, I may occasionally upload old works that I deem no longer useful in my own projects, but as my art style is actually shifting over time, inconsistency in styles may be found.
